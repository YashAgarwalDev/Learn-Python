The join method takes a sequence as argument. The sequence is written as single argument: you need to add brackets around the sequence.

If you’d like, you can pass a variable holding the sequence as argument. This makes it easier to read. We’ll use a space a seperator string in the example below.

Try the program below:

# define strings                                                         
firstname = "Bugs"
lastname = "Bunny"

# define our sequence                                                    
sequence = (firstname,lastname)

# join into new string                                                   
name = " ".join(sequence)
print(name)
